## Automated Files seggregation


# Python is extensively involved in devising this project for seggregating the files with same name under the same folder, the folder name is taken out of the file itself automatically.
# User has to just enter the path where all the files are located 


# Before 
All the files are present at one location and it's difficult to differentiate between the files
